#This code is the main code to run the GloWPa model. The model can be run for various waterborne pathogens
#and and various spatial scales and resolutions. This code is the basis for the K2P mapping tool, among others.
#This code was written by Nynke Hofstra in May 2019

#still to do: 
# add possible multiplying variables for all other variables than the ones already done
# test the makeisogrids part
# do we need to perform some checks everywhere to make sure the data are in the right format? We probably do. To be done.

#In case you want to set up scenarios, you can simply change the file overall_inputs.csv 
#by adding more lines.

# Set paths ---------------------------------------------------------------
