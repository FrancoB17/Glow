# this residence time may be too fast, as rivers are assumed to flow in straight lines from middle to middle of cells. 
#e.g. using hte formula above, if the river length is higher, then the residence time will also be higher

# note from Schulze 2005 et al.:
# the assumption of a rectangular cross section is considered
#as acceptable for bankful discharge. For less than bankfull
#discharge, which is the normal case, width and depth are
#scaled, but their ratio remains the same. Under natural conditions,
#in a flat and broad river bed, depth would decrease
#faster than width with falling discharge. Hence the model
#tends to overestimate the ratio of depth to width. As the hydraulic
#radius and thus river velocity are especially sensitive
#to changes in depth with this first approach velocity results
#for less than bankful discharge will be overestimated which
#has to be kept in mind regarding the results.
