#This script developes input files for the human emissions for the scenarios of the GloWPa model that are run automatically

#Scenario combinations (change compared to baseline (Run 1)):
#Run 2: population 150% of present ! Make sure that if treatment did not improve, more waste goes to water directly, because of lack of treatment (higher fnontreat)
#Run 3: population doubling
#Run 4: incidence: half
#Run 5: incidence: double
#Run 6: sanitation: people practicing open defecation get pits
#Run 7: sanitation: people praciticing open defecation get pits in rural areas and sewer in urban areas
#Run 8: sanitation: eradication of open defecation and 20% increase in sewers (so fewer pits) both urban and rural
#Run 9: sanitation: eradication of open defecation and doubling in sewers (so fewer pits) both urban and rural
#Run 10: onsite sludge management: dumping in water and on land eradicated
#Run 11: onsite sludge management: flushing of pits eradicated
#Run 12: treatment: adding more WWTPs (with same average treatment)  !!HOW?!! Capacity increased by 20% -> 
#Run 13: treatment: improving treatment by 1 log unit
#CLIMATE CHANGE?


#Assumption: current WWTPs are performing at or over capacity (depending on fraction not treated). So with added people
#connected or more waste coming to the WWTP, more treatment is required or all additional waste goes to water without treatment.
